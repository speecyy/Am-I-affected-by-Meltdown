## Am I affected by Meltdown?! Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) checker

#### What am I?

Proof-of-concept /

Exploit /

Checks whether system is affected by Variant 3: rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754), a.k.a MELTDOWN.

The basic idea is that user will know whether or not the running system is properly patched with
something like KAISER patchset (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/10/31/884) for example.

*** Only works on Linux for now ***

#### How it works?
It works by using */proc/kallsyms* to find system call table and checking whether the address of a
system call found by exploiting MELTDOWN match the respective one in */proc/kallsyms*.

#### What to do when you face this error "Unable to read /proc/kallsyms..."
That's because your system may be preventing the program from reading kernel symbols in /proc/kallsyms
due to /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict set to 1.
The following command will do the tricky:
```
sudo sh -c "echo 0  > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict"
```
Please open an issue if you have an idea on how to fallback to another approach in this scenario.

#### Getting started
Run *make* to compile the project

#### Example output for a system affected by Meltdown:
